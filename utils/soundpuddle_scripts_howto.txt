//Directions for FPGA config//

Step 1 - Program the SPI flash with the SoundPuddle FPGA bit file:
sudo ./xc3sprog -c ftdi -f papilio_pro_soundpuddle-mk2.bit

Step 2 - Program the SPI flash with the SoundPuddle FPGA bin file:
sudo ./zpuinoprogrammer -d /dev/ttyUSB1 -l -o 0 -R -b papilio_pro_soundpuddle-mk2.bin

//Directions for generating a new LED mapping file//
To copy hsv.c to a sketch directory (example):
cp hsv.c ../sketch/soundpuddleripple/

To generate the mapping.h file for the LED array buffer mapping: (from inside the mapping dir)
perl ../utils/create-map-from-csv.pl < ../mappings/soundpuddle-mk2-ripplemapping.csv


//Direction for depreciated HSV mapping//
To generate the hsv.c file:
make clean all
./genhsvtable > hsv.c
